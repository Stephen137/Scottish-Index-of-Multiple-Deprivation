# Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)

The aim of this project is to analyse and visualise the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) using a combination of pandas, geopandas, seaborn, matplotlib, QGIS and ArcGis Pro. The insights derived could be used by Scottish Government to help shape future resource allocation strategy.

Although I recently relocated to Krak√≥w, Poland, I was born and raised in Dundee, Scotland so this study area has an added layer of personal interest.

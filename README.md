# Scottish-Index-of-Multiple-Deprivation
The aim of this project is to analyse the geospatial and temporal changes in the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) over the period 2012 to 2020, using the ArcGis Pro Space Time Cube feature. The insights derived may help shape the future resource allocation strategy of Scottish Government.
